iscli - "Industry Standard" CLI framework for Python
====================================================

iscli is a Python framework for building command line interfaces.

The API is heavily inspired by the Flask web framework.

"Industry Standard CLI" is a phrase commonly heard in the network
equipment industry, when companies claim their products have a
similar CLI to the "IOS CLI" of the 800 pound gorilla.

This is yet another implementation of that CLI style.
